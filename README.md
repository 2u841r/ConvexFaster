## ConvexFaster

Convex version, ethanniser/NextFaster is Neon/Postgres.

## Test Data import

`npx convex import data/convex.zip`  
more info https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/import

Future plans:

- [x] Convex-Faster, using Convex instead of Neon Postgres.
- [ ] Upload images to [Convex File Storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage), instead of using image links (vercel blob storage image links)
- [ ] another repo with [Cloudflare Faster](https://x.com/ZubairIbnZamir/status/1968469764268843484) - Cloudflare D1 + R2 / Image + OpenNext. (this will be very very exciting.)
